# Finely - Personal Finance Tracker 💥

Listen up, you primitive money-grubbing meatbags! **Finely** is the most *insanely* badass desktop app for wrestling your pathetic Earth credits into submission.

Locked in a local `data.json` vault, safe from the prying eyes of interdimensional tax collectors. Clouds? Pfft, we don’t trust that garbage. Take control of your cash or get schwifty trying.
