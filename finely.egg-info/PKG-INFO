# Finely - Personal Finance Tracker 💥

<img src="finely/assets/icon/icon-tra.png" width="100">

Listen up, you primitive money-grubbing meatbags! **Finely** is the most _insanely_ badass desktop app for wrestling your pathetic Earth credits into submission. Built with Flet and Python, it’s got a _sick dark mode_ and a UI so slick it’ll make your brain short-circuit. Your data? Locked in a local `data.json` vault, safe from the prying eyes of interdimensional tax collectors. Clouds? Pfft, we don’t trust that garbage. Take control of your cash or get schwifty trying.

_Bow before its cosmic glory, you financial plebs._
